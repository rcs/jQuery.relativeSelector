Add the script tag to the page after loading jQuery.

<script src="scripts/jQuery.relativeSelector.js"></script>

Then in your code:

```javascript
$('div').relativeSelector()
```

This will give you string to be used as a selector in the existing page structure, or should be able to be used in future runs of the page.
